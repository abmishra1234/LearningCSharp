// Challenge
/*
    Create an algorithm that deletes the Kth node from the end of the list. 
    
    23 -> 2 -> 34 -> 45 ->56 ->NULL

    Delete K = 1
    23 -> 2 -> 34 -> 45 ->NULL
    
    Delete K = 4
    2 -> 34 -> 45 ->NULL

    Approach 01: Recursive Approach
    Solution -> Design your Algorithm First

    Let's iterate the LinkedList using next pointer
    
    once reach the end , start unwinding or unfolding the recursion and by that time you just try
    find the element from the end with the counter decrease by 1 with all Unwinding step,
    Until you will reach at the K == 0.

    And you also have to maintain the Curr and Prev pointer for your stack
